# Quotes App

App for managing a list of quotes, where users can _delete_ individual quotes and _reset_ all deleted quotes with a single button.

The app is designed for practice purposes and has no backend API. It resets when the app is closed and reopened.

This project was created as part of my journey to learn **Flutter framework**.

## Features

- List of Quotes: Displays a set of predefined quotes.
- Delete Quotes: Users can remove quotes one by one.
- Reset Quotes: A reset button brings back all deleted quotes.
- Custon App icon and User interface for the application.
- Tested on Real Devices: With both Android and iOS builds by flutter.
